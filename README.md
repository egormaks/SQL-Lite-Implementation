# About this project:
I'm working on this project to gain a better understanding of databases from the back-end to the front-end and to answer questions like the following:
	"How and where is data stored in memory or on a disk?"
	"Why is there only one primary key in a table?"
	"How does rolling back a transaction work?"
	"How are indices formated?"
	"How are prepared statements and meta commands stored and processed?"
To do this, this project involves writing the SQLite database language from scratch (in C). I am responsible for implementing all aspects of a 
database and am responsible for implementing the answers to the above questions.
